# Scope Fun!

## Exercise 1
The first exercise you should refactor the yearsUntilRetirement function. 
You should not edit how the function is declared but you can edit what's inside the function. 

## Exercise 2
The second exercise should return the number 9 instead of 1. 
Refactor someFunction to return 9 instead. Do not edit the where we first initialize var a. 

## Exercise 3
The third exercise should return 2 instead of 1. 
Add ONE line to the function test() that will allow our function to return the correct number.

## Exercise 4
In the fourth exercise, refactor the functions so that when third() is invoked, it returns the correct output.

## Exercise 5
The 5th exercise doesn't have a test spec. Instead, think about what this function would log to the console for a few minutes! 
To run the code and try to fix it yourself, run 'node scope-fun.js' in your terminal.
