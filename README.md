## Needs Statement
Students need to understand HTML as it forms the basis for the modern web 
documents. Students need to have the right tools to work with and view code
effectively, including version control and other command line tools. In short,
students need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Objective

Students will be able to give definitions of HTML, tags, attributes, and give
examples of each. They will be able to describe how nested tags affect one
another. Students will be able to use programs they install to write HTML and
view it in a browser. They will be able to set up and configure their IDE.
